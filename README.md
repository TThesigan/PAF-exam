 All the instructions to install and test my system
 After cloning the file system:
 Go to eclipse
 Select "Open project from file system"
 Select the folder where you have cloned my project
 Turn on xampp, in phpMyAdmin you will need a sql file to import, that is also added in this repository
 Then turn on apache tomcat server
 Run the logReg.jsp file for the Login Page
 For easy demonstration purpose we have added client interface.
 Then you can test my project... :)
 
 Note: In tomcat server the HTTP port should be 8081, if not my project will not run.
